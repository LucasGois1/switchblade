## A Programming Language

Hi! This is my first try at developing a programming language.

The porpouse is only study how a programming language works internally, of course, this project NEVER will be
complete like JS or Python, but i believe i will extract a lot of knowledge in this challenge.

### Build steps

To build this project, just enter the build folder and type:

    cmake .

This command will generate a makefile in the build folder.

Now just type do compile the program and create a entry file:

    make

### Execution

To run, just type:

    ./entry
